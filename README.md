Android Logger
==============

Useful logger for Android based on standard android.util.Log class.
Simple lightweight (< 50 Kb) implementation of SLF4J API. Easy but powerful
configuration via properties file and some additional helpful logging methods.
Easy analogue of popular log4j library.

__Android SDK Version__: API 7 [ Android 2.1 ]

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to use Android Logger in your Android application you need to do
just the following simple steps:

 - Add Android Logger as a library.

 - You need to configure Android Logger

Place the following android-logger.properties file to your source directory (src/android-logger.properties):

    # Android Logger configuration example
    
    # By default logger will print only ERROR (and higher) messages
    # with "MyApplication" tag
    root=ERROR:MyApplication
    
    # DEBUG (and higher) messages from classes of com.example.database
    # will be logged with "MyApplication-Database" tag
    logger.com.example.database=DEBUG:MyApplication-Database
    
    # All messages from classes of com.example.ui will be logged with
    # "MyApplication-UI" tag
    logger.com.example.ui=MyApplication-UI

The configuration manages which log tag will be used to print messages and
which logging level filter will be applied.


    logger.<package/classname>=<level>:<tag>
    # or
    logger.<package/classname>=<tag>

The rest of messages will be managed by root logger:

    root=<level>:<tag>
    # or
    root=<tag>

You can use VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, ASSERT as level in
configuration files.

 - You need to get logger instance to print messages

You can use LoggerManager to get a logger instance to print messages.

    package com.example.ui;

    import com.noveogroup.android.log.Logger;
    import com.noveogroup.android.log.LoggerManager;

    public class MainActivity extends Activity {

      // get a logger instance by name
      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger("com.example.ui.MyActivity");
      // get a logger instance by class
      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger(MainActivity.class);
      // just to use current class
      private static final Logger logger = LoggerManager.getLogger();

      private void foo(int value) {
        logger.i("entered MainActivity::foo value=%d", value);
        
        try {
          // some code
        } catch(IOException e) {
          logger.e("I/O error occurred", e);
        }
      }

    }

 - You can use LOG to make logging calls shorter.

Any call like LOG.someMethod() is equal to LoggerManager.getLogger().someMethod().
So, there will be some additional overhead to get a logger each time.

    import static com.noveogroup.android.log.LOG;

    public class Bar {

      public void foo() {
        LOG.i("some log message");
      }

    }

SLF4J compatibility
-------------------

Android Logger is SLF4J compatible. For example, you can write such code in
your library:

    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

    public class Bar {

      private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Bar.class);

      public void foo(int value) {
        logger.info("entered Bar::foo value={}", value);

        try {
          // some code
        } catch(IOException e) {
          logger.error("I/O error occurred", e);
        }
      }

    }

Suppose you compiled your library as JAR-file and publish it. After that anyone
who uses your JAR library will be able to add any SLF4J implementation to
change the way how the library logs messages.
The most powerful implementation of SLF4J is [LOGBack](http://logback.qos.ch/)
available for Android. Unfortunately, it has about 1 Mb size and it may be
critical for some Android applications.
Android Logger is SLF4J compatible too. So you can just add its JAR as
a library to get all your log messages in Android LogCat.
